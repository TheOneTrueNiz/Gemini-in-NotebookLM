# Gemini-in-NotebookLM
Use this code to access pipeline to Gemini from inside NotebookLM
Gemini can instruct you on the procedure to aquire an API key if you don't already have one. It's simple and takes two seconds.
Look for the line that says "YOUR API KEY HERE" and paste your API key 
Copy paste the code in its entirety with your API in designated spot into a source in NotebookLM. 
Submit your query to the pipeline by using the following format: call_gemini("Your Question Here?")

**This method is useable but unstable. You can file it under unorthodox and out of the box usage. But cool nonetheless. FYI I am not a "coder" I'm a noob and a slacker. It might not be pretty but it works.. sort of.
